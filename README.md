# Survey Analysis Plots Explanation

This document explains the four types of plots generated by our survey analysis script, their purpose, and how to interpret them.

## 1. Declarative vs. Scenario Comparison Plots

**File Pattern:** `declarative_vs_scenario_[value].png`

### Purpose
These plots compare how developers' stated values (declarative statements) align with their reported actions in specific scenarios. For each core value (Correctness, Maintainability, Software Standards, Privacy, Fairness, Accountability, Human Relations, and Social Impact), we create a grouped bar chart.

### How to Read
- **X-axis:** Response scores from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree)
- **Y-axis:** Percentage of respondents
- **Bars:** 
  - Blue bars show responses to declarative statements (e.g., "Correctness is important to me")
  - Orange bars show responses to scenario-based questions (e.g., "I thoroughly test my code")
- **Interpretation:** 
  - If the distributions are similar, it suggests alignment between stated values and actions
  - If they differ, it indicates potential gaps between what developers value and how they act

### Key Observations
- **Correctness:** Shows strong alignment between stated importance and actual testing behavior, with most responses clustered around 6-7
- **Privacy:** Reveals a gap where developers rate privacy highly in declarative statements but show more varied responses in actual privacy-related scenarios
- **Social Impact:** Demonstrates the largest gap between stated values and actions, particularly in scenarios involving negative impacts

## 2. Mean vs. Mode Analysis Plots

**File Pattern:** `mean_vs_mode_[number].png`

### Purpose
These plots identify questions where there's a significant difference between the average (mean) response and the most common (mode) response. This helps identify topics where developers' opinions are polarized or where there's a mismatch between typical and average responses.

### How to Read
- **X-axis:** Response scores from 1 to 7
- **Y-axis:** Number of respondents
- **Vertical Lines:**
  - Red dashed line: Mean value
  - Blue dotted line: Mode value
- **Interpretation:**
  - Large differences between mean and mode suggest diverse opinions
  - The plot shows the top 5 questions with the largest differences
  - The summary table provides exact values for all questions

### Key Observations
- **Fairness and Ethics:** Shows the largest mean-mode differences (1.58 for Importance_Fairness), indicating polarized views on ethical considerations
- **Technical Practices:** Reveals smaller differences (0.21 for Code_Structure_Maintainability), suggesting more consensus on technical matters
- **Team Dynamics:** Moderate differences in questions about responsibility and communication, showing some variation in team-oriented values

## 3. "I think" vs. "I do" Scatter Plot

**File:** `think_vs_do_alignment.png`

### Purpose
This plot shows the relationship between developers' stated beliefs ("I think...") and their reported actions ("I do...") across all categories. Each point represents a category, colored by whether it's a Technical or Ethical consideration.

### How to Read
- **X-axis:** Average "I think" score
- **Y-axis:** Average "I do" score
- **Points:** 
  - Each point represents a category
  - Colors indicate Technical vs. Ethical considerations
- **Red Line:** Perfect alignment (y=x)
- **Interpretation:**
  - Points above the line: Actions exceed stated beliefs
  - Points below the line: Actions fall short of stated beliefs
  - Distance from line: Magnitude of the gap

### Key Observations
- **Technical Categories:** Most technical points (Correctness, Maintainability) cluster near the diagonal, showing good alignment between beliefs and actions
- **Ethical Categories:** Ethical points (Privacy, Fairness) show more scatter, indicating greater variation between stated values and actual practices
- **Overall Pattern:** Technical considerations show more consistent alignment than ethical ones, suggesting developers might find it easier to implement technical values than ethical ones

## 4. Aggregated "I think" vs. "I do" Plot

**File:** `think_vs_do_aggregated.png`

### Purpose
This plot provides a more detailed view of the alignment between beliefs and actions, showing the mean values and their uncertainty for each category.

### How to Read
- **X-axis:** Mean "I think" score
- **Y-axis:** Mean "I do" score
- **Points:** 
  - Each point represents a category
  - Colors indicate Technical vs. Ethical considerations
- **Error Bars:** 
  - Show standard error (precision of the mean estimate)
  - No caps for cleaner visualization
- **Red Line:** Perfect alignment (y=x)
- **Interpretation:**
  - Points' positions relative to the line show alignment
  - Error bars show the reliability of the estimates
  - Categories are labeled for easy identification
  - Technical vs. Ethical considerations are color-coded

### Key Observations
- **Error Bar Patterns:** Technical categories show smaller error bars, indicating more consistent responses, while ethical categories have larger error bars, showing more variation
- **Cluster Analysis:** Technical points form a tighter cluster above the diagonal, while ethical points are more spread out, suggesting more diverse approaches to ethical considerations
- **Notable Outliers:** Social Impact shows the largest deviation from the diagonal, with actions falling short of stated values, while Correctness shows the strongest alignment

## General Notes

1. All plots use a consistent color scheme and styling for easy comparison
2. Error bars and statistical measures help assess the reliability of the findings
3. The plots are designed to be publication-ready with clear labels and legends
4. All plots are saved in high resolution (300 DPI) for both screen viewing and printing

## Using These Plots in Analysis

When analyzing the results:
1. Start with the aggregated plot to get an overview
2. Use the scatter plot to identify patterns
3. Dive into specific categories using the declarative vs. scenario plots
4. Use the mean vs. mode analysis to identify areas of consensus or disagreement

These visualizations together provide a comprehensive view of how software developers' values, beliefs, and actions align across different aspects of their work. 

## Overall Insights

The analysis reveals several key patterns:
1. Developers show stronger alignment between beliefs and actions in technical areas compared to ethical considerations
2. There's more consensus and consistency in technical practices than in ethical decision-making
3. The largest gaps between stated values and actions appear in areas related to social impact and fairness
4. Error bars and statistical measures suggest that technical values are implemented more consistently than ethical ones
